In the home component
forms now display if the person is host or if player

if host, push player into game obj
    add both decks to the game obj
    send the update
    (for now, use boolean switch to indicate that the game is in session; only allow one game 
    ONLY ONCE GAME STARTS)


if player, get game obj that already exists
    push player into [] if game not in session
    send the update

use server side to push socket.id into that player's object


got the ID on the client side.
    I need to push this ID into the player object automatically
        try subscribing on ngINIT of home component



ok, I lifted the client socket id into the player object
    Now I need to build the player before pushing
    add id to local storage via js cookie
    now I need to push this player into the players array
    sent the updates back and stuff

next steps:
    make sure the player function works too --> updates whenever someone joins
        maybe make sure you cant have two hosts
            use a boolean? hasHost = true
        
    create a lobby component --> pass the game object to it
        focus on listing each player and their name
        populate the decks --> shuffle the decks
